Okay. Report. My supervisor tells that I should work more with my thesis, but I will write report for Mikey. Pay your attention on it, before give me only 60% of overall scores! :)
So, I took this repo: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning and cloned it to mu laptop. Here are 7 files and 1 folder. What I did: I created repo with empty README.md and decided to devide my repo on 4 branches: master, 1st, 2nd and 3rd - for each part with 2 files or file+folder. All the story you can see in the graph in Github:
1) master folder is for submiting README and LICENSE
2) 1st branch is for submiting 'blogs' and 'books'
3) 2nd branch is for submiting 'meetings' and 'courses'
4) 3rd branch is for submitting 'ml-curiculum' and folder 'scripts'
5) 'V' is for 'Vendetta'. Or 'vampire'.
Then I tried to chance a lot my README in every branch. My fantasy is not very flexible, so, mostly I deleted some text.
In the end I merged all the files. Yes, I had structure as the prime repo, but with changes - as I understood that is what I need to do.
Next, I removed the only folder from my repo - 'scripts', and put my tasty, amazing, heavenly report. Greet it, love and grade! ^_^
